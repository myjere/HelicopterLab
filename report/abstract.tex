A movable arm capable of lateral and longitudinal motion by applied thrust from two attached rotors is stabilized by a basic regulatory layer with pitch and elevation angle PID controllers. The feasibility of controlling the arm to move from an initial equilibrium state to a given travel angle setpoint is investigated by employing in an open loop an optimal sequence of inputs for the PID controllers obtained by minimizing quadratic objective functions subject to linear as well as non-linear constraints. Enhanced tracking of the optimal travel trajectory is achieved by augmenting the basic control layer with a linear-quadratic controller.
