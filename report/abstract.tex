A movable arm capable of lateral and longitudinal motion by applied thrust from an attached dual rotor pitch head assembly is stabilized by pitch and elevation angle PID controllers, and the feasibility of controlling the arm by employing in an open loop a sequence of pitch and elevation angle setpoints is investigated. The input sequnces are obtained by minimizing a quadratic objective function constrained by the system dynamics and with linear and non-linear constraints according to the given travel and elevation trajectory. Enhanced performance is achieved by adding a Linear quadratic controller to update the optimal input sequence with state feedback.
