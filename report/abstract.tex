\begin{abstract}\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
This document outlines a few important aspects of the lab report. It contains some advice on both content and layout. The Latex source for this document is also published, and you can use it as a template of sorts for your own report.

When you write your own report, this section (the abstract) should contain a \emph{very} short summary of what the lab is about and what you have done.
