\section{Optimal Control of Pitch/Travel and Elevation with and without Feedback}\label{sec:prob4}

\subsection{State space model}

\subsection{Discretization}

\subsection{Optimization problem with nonlinear constraints}

\subsection{Optional: Additonal constraints}

\subsection{Results and discussion}
Each of the four problems should have their own discussion of results.
