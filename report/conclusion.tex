\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Optimal operation of the movable arm is achieved by minimizing a quadratic cost function, and precomputed input sequences are supplemented by state feedback. The linear model is shown to yield satisfactory performance, and enhanced performance is achieved by adding constraints designed to minimize nonlinear effects.
