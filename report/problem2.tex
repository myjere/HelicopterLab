\section{Optimal Control of Pitch/Travel without Feedback}\label{sec:prob2}
Answer all the parts of the first exercise in an organized and clear manner. You should of course try to get good results in all the exercises, but if you have made a good effort without achieving great performance, a good discussion of possible reasons is just as good. Present your thinking and efforts and discuss possible reasons for good or bad results.

Include plots of all relevant results, but make sure you don't overwhelm the reader with too many plots. Also keep in mind that the plots should be as ``readable'' as possible; that is, they should not be too hard to interpret.

There are some important things to consider when exporting figures from MATLAB, most importantly which format you use. Never ever use JPEG for anything that is not a photography or similar. Any figure, like a plot or block diagram, must never be stored as a JPEG. If you zoom in on Figure~\ref{fig:constraint_jpg} you can see a lot of noise close to any of the dark curves and lines, this is due to the compression in JPEG. Figure~\ref{fig:constraint_jpg} will look horrible both on a screen and on paper.

The PNG format is slightly better for plots, but since it is a raster format (a grid of pixels), it looks ugly if you zoom in. It also looks ugly if you scale it, both on a screen and on paper. Try to avoid PNG if you can. Figures~\ref{fig:constraint_png} and~\ref{fig:constraint_png_large} are both PNG figures; the latter being a larger figure scaled more than the former. Note both how choppy and ugly the blue curve is, and how the different sizes create inconsistent font sizes.

The simplest way to get a reasonably good looking plot is to save it as EPS in MATLAB. Do this by clicking ``File'' in the figure window, and the ``Save As\ldots''; choose ``EPS file (*.eps)'' in the ``Save as type:'' menu.\footnote{pdfLatex does not support EPS directly, but since we have loaded the \emph{epstodf} package, this is not a problem.} Figure~\ref{fig:constraint_eps} shows a plot in EPS format. Since EPS is a vector format, the Figure can be scaled and still look good (but mind the font size!). If you zoom in you can see that the curve and the letters/numbers are smooth. A figure in vector format will usually look good both on a screen and on paper.

Note that the size of the actual figure window in MATLAB determines how large the exported figure is. Hence, if you enlarge the figure window before exporting, you will need to scale the figure by a larger factor in the report. This will lead to a tiny font in the figure. There are many better ways of exporting graphics from MATLAB, but they quickly become fairly involved. The above method of exporting to EPS will in most cases give nice figures.

You can write Latex in your MATLAB figures. The script used to create Figures~\ref{fig:constraint_jpg}--\ref{fig:constraint_eps} is included in Section~\ref{sec:plot_constraint_m}. Do not use a screen shot of a scope of figure in MATLAB in your report.
