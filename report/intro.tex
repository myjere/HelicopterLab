\section{Introduction}

Your introduction should contain an overview of the work you were assigned, as well as a few sentences putting the work into a larger perspective. You should also give a quick description of how the report is organized (as is done below).


The work presented in this report reflects the assigned task of computing optimizing behavior of a movable arm actuated by two rotors. The optimal path from an initial state to the desired state is computed, both in one and two dimensions. In both cases state feedback is investigated as a way of eliminating drift from optimal path. Lastly, a nonlinear constraint is added to the optimization problem. Additional constraints are also investigated as a way of limiting nonlinear effects.
