\subsection{PID-(re)tuning}
The pretuned PID showed unsatisfactory performance and was retuned to better serve as the stable plant for the rest of the assignement. 

\subsection{Results and discussion}

Figure \ref{fig:step_response} shows the pitch and elevation step response to a step input, as well as the resulting travel rate result
